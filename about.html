    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
      My name is Luke Sumner, and this blog is part of my work for ENGL 170:
      First-Year Writing at Lindenwood University. Throughout the semester, I use
      this space to explore ideas about writing, artificial intelligence, and
      intellectual work.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this blog, I regularly reflect on course readings, respond to classmates’
      posts, and connect class discussions to real-world examples. The goal is not
      just to summarize ideas, but to question them, test them, and develop my own
      perspective as a writer.
    </p>

    <p>
      All posts here are written for an academic audience within our course blog
      network and are intended to show my growth as a thinker and writer over the
      semester.
